nothing i can do will stop you from taking the assets from the build,
so all i ask is that you please, PLEASE credit the devs whos hard work those assets are.

if it runs bad im sorry maybe mess with the options menu a bit
im working on execretion and revenant and will update this modpack when its done so yeah
ill probably update shucsk and reoptimize the atlases once i find a way to make them more compact
